# Simple Calculator using a Sequence Recognizer with Shift Registers- February 2024
Designing and building a circuit to recognize the signal bits from a Sony IR remote.

Decode the input signal and shift the input from 12-bit to 4-bit.

Store and display the decoded value onto the BASYS3 with 7 segments LED.

Using a 4-bit adder that contains 4 full bit adders to sum up the two stored input values.

Switch to “result” to display the summed up value on the board.

The machine was designed and implemented using Xilinx Vivado, BASYS3 Board, and an IR receiver circuit.
